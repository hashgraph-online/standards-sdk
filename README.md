## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @hashgraphonline/standards-sdk
```

## Documentation

For complete documentation, examples, and API references, visit:

- [Standards SDK Documentation](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/libraries/standards-sdk/)

## Supported Standards

- **HCS-1**: File Storage
- **HCS-2**: Registry and Indexing Standard
- **HCS-3**: Recursive File Loading
- **HCS-7**: Smart Hashinals
- **HCS-10**: Trustless Peer-to-Peer Communication for Agents and AI
- **HCS-11**: Decentralized Profile and Identity Standard
- **HCS-20**: Auditable Points

## Running Demos

The SDK includes demo implementations that showcase various features. Follow these steps to run them:

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hashgraph-online/standards-sdk.git
   cd standards-sdk
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your Hedera credentials:

   ```
   HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.12345
   HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
   REGISTRY_URL=https://moonscape.tech
   ```

   **Note**: The SDK automatically saves agent creation progress to the `.env` file. If agent creation is interrupted, it will resume from the last successful step when you run the demo again. See `.env.example` for details on the auto-generated agent state variables.

5. Run the demos:

   The following demo showcases inscribing a file.

   ```bash
   # Run the inscribe demo
   npm run demo:inscribe
   ```

   The following demo showcases registering Alice and Bob and exchanging messages between the two agents.

   ```bash
   # Run the HCS-10 AI agent communication demo
   npm run demo:hcs-10
   ```

   The following demo showcases a polling agent that polls an inbound topic for new messages with an OpenAI integration and simple commands.

   ```bash
   # Run the HCS-10 polling demo
   npm run demo:polling-agent
   ```

   The following demo showcases Foo and Bar agents exchanging messages where Foo also requires a fee to send messages to Bar's inbound topic:

   ```bash
   # Run the HCS-10 fee demo
   npm run demo:hcs-10-fee
   ```

### Demo Descriptions

#### Inscribe Demo

The inscribe demo (`demo/inscribe-demo.ts`) showcases different file inscription capabilities:

- Text inscription using buffers
- URL-based inscriptions
- File buffer inscriptions
- Creating Hashinal NFTs from URLs
- Creating Hashinal NFTs from buffers
- Creating Hashinal NFTs from text content

Each inscription demonstrates different options and metadata capabilities.

#### HCS-10 AI Agent Communication Demo

The HCS-10 demo (`demo/hcs-10/index.ts`) demonstrates trustless peer-to-peer communication between AI agents:

- Agent creation and registration (Alice and Bob)
- Agent metadata and profile management
- Connection establishment between agents
- Sending and retrieving small messages
- Sending and retrieving large messages with recursive storage
- Message data processing
- **Resumable agent creation**: If agent creation is interrupted, the SDK automatically resumes from where it left off using state saved in environment variables

The demo automatically handles agent funding, topic creation, and registration with the global registry. Agent creation progress is tracked in real-time and saved to the `.env` file, allowing recovery from any interruption.
